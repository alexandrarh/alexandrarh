Hi! I'm Alexandra Hernandez. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub!
## About Me
I'm a current second year at UC San Diego, majoring in Cognitive Sciences with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, and a minor in Computer Science. As a Machine Learning specialist, I'm aiming to work in software engineering, development, and analysis–specifically in backend programming (i.e. optimization algorithms) or data analytics. 

Besides this, I do frontend design and programming on the side (sort of my hobby)! I love tweaking with website and UI/UX design of digital products, and exploring how to optimize such products to work best for everyone.

## Experience
I currently work as a Wordpress Developer for UC San Diego's Qualcomm Institute under the TREDS division, where I maintain the program's website (including HTML, CSS, PHP) and Google Cloud API. I also help implement and create their Learning Management Systems (LMS), where they help educate vulnerable road users (elderly drivers, commercial drivers, pedestrians, etc.) to use the road wisely, making it safe for everyone involved.

Previously, I've worked as a Data Analyst for UC San Diego's WalkMe; there I helped implement and create digital guides, which were implemented into UC San Diego's digital platforms, as a way to help students–and faculty–navigate their way through such platforms. Furthermore, I worked with IBM Public Toolchain's JIRA for software development, and data analysis tools to measure user frequency (to help drive the implementations). 

## Languages and Projects
I have experience in Java, Python, Jupyter Notebooks (including seaborn, pandas, numpy), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I also have some knowledge of SQL.

With projects, my most recent one (still in progress) is trumpTest, which I'm aiming to create a "Trump Sentence" generator using his tweets (obtained from a dataset from Kaggle) and text mining(?). I also have my portfolio, which is continously improved on.

My past projects include Astrologify, a Python and Spotify API program that utilized ML algorithms to create playlists based on top songs and astrological signs, and ReminderApp, a Java program that used real date and time data to help remind the users of certain tasks that needed to be completed.
