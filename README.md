Hi! I'm Alexandra Hernandez (she/her/hers), a current second year at UC San Diego. I'm a Cognitive Sciences major (BS) specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, and currently minoring in Computer Sciences (BS). Besides this, I also specialize in design, specifically UI/UX.

As a Cognitive Sciences ML/Neural Computation–and Computer Science–undergrad, I'm hoping to go into the computer science field in the future, specifically in software development and AI. Though I'm only a second year, I've worked on multiple projects, most notably Astrologify, ReminderApp, and my own portfolio. The source codes for those projects can be found on my GitHub (here)!

*Programming* wise, I know Python and Java; with *design*, I work heavily with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. For my coding environments, I have experience in VSCode, NetBeans, and Atom. For my UI/UX work, I use Figma and Apple Sketch.

Currently, I work as a Wordpress Developer for the Qualcomm Institute at UC San Diego.
