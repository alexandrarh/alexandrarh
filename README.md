Hi! I'm alexandra hernandez (she/her/hers), and I'm studying at UC San Diego as a Cognitive Sciences major with a specialization in ML/neural computation. 
I'm hoping to go into the computer science field in the future, specifically in software development and AI. As of now, I know Python, Java, and JavaScriptâ€“definitely
will be learning more in the future. 
Currently, I work as a Data Analyst for UC San Diego's WalkMe, a company dedicated to creating accessible technologies through frontend development.
