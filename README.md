Hi! I'm Alexandra Hernandez. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub!
## About Me
I'm a current second year at UC San Diego, majoring in Cognitive Sciences with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, and a minor in Computer Science. As a Machine Learning specialist, I'm aiming to work in software engineering, development, and analysis–specifically in backend programming (i.e. optimization algorithms) or data analytics. 

## Experience
Currently, I work as a Data Management Assistant for the Scripps Institute of Oceanography under their CCE-LTER division; under the SIO, I process raw data from their researchers using Excel and CSV files, and run existing programs to make the data readable. I'm also responsible for documenting datasets with appropriate metadata and uploading data to existing databases and online repositories, as well as maintaining publicly submitted data is available on our several project websites.

Previously, I worked as a Wordpress Developer for UC San Diego's Qualcomm Institute under the TREDS division, where I maintain the program's website (including HTML, CSS, PHP) and Google Cloud API. I also help implement and create their Learning Management Systems (LMS), where they help educate vulnerable road users (elderly drivers, commercial drivers, pedestrians, etc.) to use the road wisely, making it safe for everyone involved.

I've also worked as a Data Analyst for UC San Diego's WalkMe; there I helped implement and create digital guides, which were implemented into UC San Diego's digital platforms, as a way to help students–and faculty–navigate their way through such platforms. Furthermore, I worked with IBM Public Toolchain's JIRA for software development, and data analysis tools to measure user frequency (to help drive the implementations). 

## Languages and Projects
I have experience in Java, Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks (including seaborn, pandas, numpy), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

With projects, my most recent one is "Digital Art Keywords," a research data science project aimed at studying the relationship between caption keywords and content popularity (on DeviantArt) using several data visualizations and machine learning models like Lassos and Decision Trees. I also have my portfolio, which is *continously* improved on.

My past projects include Astrologify, a Python and Spotify API program that utilized ML algorithms to create playlists based on top songs and astrological signs, and ReminderApp, a Java program that used real date and time data to help remind the users of certain tasks that needed to be completed.
