Hi! I'm Alexandra Hernandez. Thanks for stopping by!
## About Me
I'm a rising fourth year Machine Learning/Neural Computation major (with a Computer Science minor) at the University of California, San Diego. I specialize in in data visualization/analyzation, data cleanup, scientific research, API implementations, applications testing, and machine learning algorithm optimization. I'm aiming to work in data analysis and research, machine learning engineering, and/or software development.

## Experience
Currently, I work as a Data Management Assistant for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography under their CCE-LTER division; under the SIO, I process raw data from their researchers using Excel and CSV files, and run existing programs to make the data readable. I'm also responsible for documenting datasets with appropriate metadata and uploading data to existing databases and online repositories, as well as maintaining publicly submitted data is available on our several project websites.

Previously, I worked as a Wordpress Developer for UC San Diego's Qualcomm Institute under the TREDS division, where I maintain the program's website (including HTML, CSS, PHP) and Google Cloud API. I also help implement and create their Learning Management Systems (LMS), where they help educate vulnerable road users (elderly drivers, commercial drivers, pedestrians, etc.) to use the road wisely, making it safe for everyone involved.

I've also worked as a Data Analyst for UC San Diego's WalkMe; there I helped implement and create digital guides, which were implemented into UC San Diego's digital platforms, as a way to help students–and faculty–navigate their way through such platforms. Furthermore, I worked with IBM Public Toolchain's JIRA for software development, and data analysis tools to measure user frequency (to help drive the implementations). 

## Languages and Projects
I work primarily in Python, Java, Bash, VIM, Jupyter, SQL, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm currently working on [Battery Cycle Visualizer](https://battery-cycle-visualizer.streamlit.app), a web app dedicated to generating data visualizations for battery cycles observed via Neware and Arbin software. Hosted using Streamlit, my app runs on Python (with Pandas and Matplotlib) and used primarily by the Chen Lab at the University of California, San Diego. 

I also host my website [alexavndra.github.io](https://alexavndra.github.io) with GitHub pages, and is structured with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This serves as my online portfolio for potential employers and fellow academics to view.

My past projects include "AI Ethics and Facial Recognition," a group project dedicated to examining the ethical implications of facial recognition software in day-to-day life, "Accent Atlas," a project examining the accuracy of k-means clustering and other unsupervised ML algorithms in differentiating between different spoken accents, "Digital Art Keywords," a research data science project aimed at studying the relationship between caption keywords and content popularity (on DeviantArt) using several data visualizations and machine learning models like Lassos and Decision Trees, Astrologify, a Python and Spotify API program that utilized ML algorithms to create playlists based on top songs and astrological signs, and ReminderApp, a Java program that used real date and time data to help remind the users of certain tasks that needed to be completed.
